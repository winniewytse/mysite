My native language is Cantonese, and I also speak English, Mandarin, and know a little bit of Japanese. I have never thought of leaving Hong Kong, until the Umbrella movement in 2014, during when I was a second-year student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Advised by our respectable mentors, my partner, Kennedy Chi-pan Wong, and I decided to continue our undergraduate studies at the University of British Columbia (UBC).\nI began my journey in Quantitative Psychology in the third year of my undergraduate studies, at the UBC SEM LAB under the guidance of Dr. Victoria Savalei and Dr. Xijuan (Cathy) Zhang. I am very grateful to both Vika and Cathy, who sparked my interest in quantitative methods for psychological and behavioral research and provided immense support and training to me.\nI am now pursuing a Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Dr. Hok Chio (Mark) Lai at the USC MMM Lab. Mark has excellent insights to quantitative problems, and he has greatly been inspiring my research. He gives me plenteous opportunities to develop my research expertise, gain experiences in teaching and mentoring, and collaborate with researchers in other disciplines. I am beyond thankful for his mentorship.\nI personally like dystopian stories, perhaps because in them I often find condolences. When I was writing this paragraph, Hong Kong, our hometown, has flipped another page of its dystopian story. As writing about them—the stories, the history—may break the National Security Law, please forgive me for refraining from unveiling them here. It’s getting harder and harder to tell the truths, our stories, our experiences. And it’s even more difficult to have people listen and believe in them. If you ever have a chance, I would sincerely appreciate your time and patience to learn about the dystopian story of our lovely hometown. While years have been challenging to Hong Kong, as well as to the world due to Covid, let’s not lose hope and continue to stand for the values we believe in.\nBe WaTer, my friends.\n\n\n\n\n  .cover img {\n    width: 80%;\n  }\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nIncoporting Uncertainty to Sample Size Planning in Multilevel Studies\nStandard sample size planning software (e.g., G*Power, PowerUpR) requires an input of parameter values. However, in the study design phase, the parameter values, such as effect size, are by definition unknown. While providing our best educated guess is a common practice, ignoring uncertainty can lead to erroneous sample size calculation. The effect of ignoring uncertainty can exacerbate in multilevel studies, which involve additional parameters, such as intraclass correlation. What should researchers do to address uncertainty about parameter values in sample size planning?\nMy research develops a hybrid-classical Bayesian (HCB) approach that incorporates uncertainty to sample size planning in multilevel studies. The HCB approach allows researchers to specify no only their best educated guess of the parameter values, but also their uncertainty about those values. This approach realistically calculate the sample size needed in the new study and appropriately control power at the desired level.\nMultilevel Regression and Poststratification on Social Media Data\nPrediction of subnational outcomes (e.g., number of covid cases in a county) using language features on social media (e.g., positive emotions and health) has become increasingly popular in psychological research. This task often encounters two major challenges: (a) social media samples are skewed toward certain subgroups, leading to nonrepresentative prediction, and (b) aggregating individual-level textual features at the county level can result in erroneous predictions. Therefore, my research team proposes using (a) postratification, which adjusts the weight of the textual features according to the proportion of the subgroups in the population, to address nonrepresentativeness, and (b) multilevel modeling, which accounts for the hierarchical structure of social media data (e.g., tweets nested within users nested within counties), to address issues with aggregation.\nMeasurement Invariance on Psychological Scales with Ordered Categorical Items\nPsychological scales are often used to measure latent traits, such as personality and beliefs. For valid group comparisons of composite (i.e., sum or mean) scores of a scale, measurement invariance is a prerequisite, which ensures the scale measures the latent traits equivalently across groups. In general, there are four levels of measurement invariance: configural, metric, scalar, and strict. Strict invariance is least often to be tested in practice, because scalar invariance allows valid use of composite scores for scales with continuous items. In my research, I evaluate whether scalar invariance supports valid use of composite scores for scales with ordered-categorical items and provide guidelines on the requirements under different conditions.\n\n\n\n",
